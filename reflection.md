- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I was interested in how using the blueprint from one class can effect the creation of others. I thought it would be more complicated than I initially thought, but the idea behind using "extends" and super() felt intuitive.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Understanding how the hashtable worked, in particular for printCollection(), was quite difficult for me so I would advise taking the time to learn about them before doing this homework. I was also confused if we were supposed to implement anything in the main function.
